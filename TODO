MA - translations between FP, CG, and FC (SD)
MA - multipartite Bell stuff (SD)
MA - generalized Bell states
SD - noise maps: general last argument or separate function?
SD - NL/steering/incompatibility/entanglement robustness SDPs?
SD - KetSparse
MT - Random Channels, Random Isometries, Random Random
MT - Section for Channels/Superoperators (add Choi map, etc etc)
SD - Properly add measurements/states from https://gitlab.com/tqo/sqma/
CG - In _dps_constraints! bypass new variables when n = 1, as then only PPT is needed
CG - GME detection with DPS?
CG - Basic state discrimination stuff?
CG - state_dicke
SD - Check useful functions by Felix Huber (https://bitbucket.org/huberfe/qgeo/src/master/README.txt)
